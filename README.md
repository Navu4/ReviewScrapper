### Web Scrapping
Web scraping is a technique using which the webpages from the internet are fetched and parsed
to understand and extract specific information similar to a human being. Web scrapping
consists of two parts:
- Web Crawling→ Accessing the webpages over the internet and pulling data from
them.
- HTML Parsing→ Parsing the HTML content of the webpages obtained through web
crawling and then extracting specific information from it.
Hence, web scrappers are applications/bots, which automatically send requests to websites and
then extract the desired information from the website output.
